TomTom Sports Connect Container
===============================

This is an effort to run TomTom Sports Connect from within a Docker container.

TomTom Sports Connect is a desktop application required to update TomTom
Adventurer sports watch, which is available and maintained for Microsoft
Windows and MacOS operating systems.

There's also an [unofficial Linux version][1] (`.deb`) tested on Ubuntu 14.04
and 16.04. It was also reported to work on Ubuntu 17.04, 17.10, 18.04 and
Mint 18 ([follow the discussion][2]).

This is my effort to make TomTom Sports Connect run on all Linux systems.

## How it works

Host machine `/tmp/.X11-unix` socket and `/dev/bus/usb` devices are shared with
a docker container runnnig [TomTom Sports Connect unofficial Linux version][1]
allowing TomTom Sports Connect usage wherever there's a running docker instance.

## How to use

1. Clone this repo
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/PauloASilva/TomTomSportsConnect && cd TomTomSportsConnect
    ```
2. Build docker image
    ```
    $ docker build -t tomtomsc:latest .
    ```
3. Run TomTom Sports Connect
    ```
    $ ./TomTomSportsConnect
    ```

    optionally you can run the container yourself
    ```
    $ docker run -it \
        --privileged \
        -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
        -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb \
        -e DISPLAY=unix$DISPLAY \
        --name tomtomsc \
        --rm \
        TomTomSportsConnect
    ```

    **Note**: you may have to disable X access control to get the X11 forwarded.
    To do so run `$ xhost +` before running `TomTomSportsConnect` or
    `docker run`

## Caveats

* X access control (`xhost` needs to be disabled)
    ```
    $ xhost +
    ```
